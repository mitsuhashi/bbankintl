        * 10.5 Nothing in this MTA shall operate to exclude or limit the Applicant’s Liability to UK Biobank for any loss, damage, costs or expenses arising from:

        * **内容の比較結果**: 部分一致
        * **判断理由**: UKBBの条文10は、双方の責任制限について詳細に規定しています。一方、EGAの条文6は、データ提供者側の責任を幅広く免除する点に焦点を当てています。両者とも責任の制限について言及していますが、内容の範囲と詳細さが異なります。特に、EGAの条文6bはUKBBの条文10.2と類似しており、「loss of profit」を含む「all liability」を排除しています。
    * **対応するNIHの条文**
        * 4. Limitation of Liability [May consider including a cap on liability/damages].
        * **内容の比較結果**: 不一致
        * **判断理由**: NIHの条文は責任制限について言及していますが、具体的な内容が記載されておらず、単に「考慮する」という提案にとどまっています。UKBBの条文10は、詳細な責任制限の条項を含んでいます。

    * 11. Term
        * 11.1 The term of this MTA shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the Completion Date unless terminated sooner in accordance with clause 12 or in accordance with law.
        * 11.2 The Term of this MTA may be extended by the Applicant (and with the agreement of UK Biobank) during the final year of the Approved Research Project in the following one (1) year increments:
            * 11.2.1 for a minimum of period of one (1) year;
            * 11.2.2 for a period of two (2) years; or
            * 11.2.3 for a maximum period of three (3) years;
        * on application to UK Biobank setting out (in reasonable detail) the reasons for the extension request and subject to the payment of the relevant further Access Charges.
        * 11.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the extensions set out in clause 11.2 above can be applied cumulatively (subject to applicable Access Charges) so that, for example, an extension of 3 years may be granted to take the Approved Research Project duration from 3 years to 6 years, and this may then be extended by a further 3 years to 9 years and so on.
    * **対応するEGAの条文**
        * なし
        * **判断理由**: EGAには契約期間の開始、終了、延長について具体的に言及している条文はありません。

        * 8. Term and Termination
            * a. Term: The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as set forth in this Section 8, shall remain in effect [may consider a specified term; e.g., set number of years, or a broader end date, e.g., until completion of the Research].
        * **内容の比較結果**: 部分一致
        * **判断理由**: NIHの条文8aは、契約期間の開始と終了について言及しており、UKBBの条文11.1と部分的に一致します。ただし、NIHの条文は具体的な期間について「考慮する」という提案にとどまっており、UKBBの条文11.2のような期間延長に関する詳細な規定はありません。

    * 12. Termination and consequences of termination
        * 12.1 UK Biobank shall be entitled to terminate this MTA immediately by written notice to the Applicant if the Applicant:
            * 12.1.1 commits any breach of a material provision of this MTA or a material breach of this MTA, and, in the case of a breach capable of remedy, fails to remedy the same within 10 days after receipt of a written notice giving particulars of the breach and requiring it to be remedied; or
            * 12.1.2 ceases, is likely to cease, or threatens to cease carrying on business or suffers an Insolvency Event, or is subject to a serious, adverse regulatory finding.
        * 12.2 Upon expiry of the MTA pursuant to clause 11.1 above or termination of this MTA by UK Biobank pursuant to clause 12.1 or in accordance with law:
            * 12.2.1 the grant of rights and all licences to the Applicant under this MTA shall be automatically terminated; and
            * 12.2.2 the Applicant shall destroy the Materials or otherwise render them permanently inaccessible and confirm in writing to access@ukbiobank.ac.uk that this has been done. For the avoidance of doubt, the Applicant shall not be required to destroy Results Data or Other Data subject to the provisions of this MTA being complied with.
        * 12.3 Without prejudice to the foregoing and to any other rights or remedies that UK Biobank may have, UK Biobank may take the following steps if there is a breach that entitles UK Biobank to terminate this MTA under clause 12.1:
            * 12.3.1 it may prohibit the Applicant PI, Applicant Researchers and any other researchers from the Applicant Institution from accessing any further Materials from within the UK Biobank resource for an indefinite period of time; and/or
            * 12.3.2 it may elect to inform the relevant personnel within the defaulting Applicant Institution, funders of the defaulting Applicant PI and/or governing or other relevant regulatory bodies.
        * 12.4 Notwithstanding termination of this MTA for any reason, the provisions of clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17 shall continue in force in accordance with their respective terms.
        * 12.5 Termination or expiry of this MTA shall not affect the rights and obligations of the parties accrued at the date or termination or expiry.
    * **対応するEGAの条文**
        * 11. The User Institution agrees to destroy/discard the Data held, once it is no longer used for the Project, unless obliged to retain the data for archival purposes in conformity with audit or legal requirements.
        * 15. XXXXX may terminate this agreement by written notice to the User Institution. If this agreement terminates for any reason, the User Institution will be required to destroy any Data held, including copies and backup copies. This clause does not prevent the User Institution from retaining these data for archival purpose in conformity with audit or legal requirements.
        * **内容の比較結果**: 部分一致
        * **判断理由**: EGAの条文15は、UKBBの条文12.1および12.2と部分的に一致します。いずれも、契約終了時にデータの破棄を義務付けています。ただし、UKBBの条文12は、違反による即時終了や終了後の権利・義務の存続についてなど、より詳細な終了規定を含んでいます。EGAの条文11も、プロジェクト終了後のデータ破棄について規定しており、UKBBの条文12.2の内容と類似しています。
    * **対応するNIHの条文**
        * 8. Term and Termination
            * b. Termination: Either party may terminate this Agreement upon [insert number] days prior written notice to the other party for any reason or no reason. Registry may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Researcher if Registry is no longer permitted to share the Data with Researcher. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party, which material breach is not cured within [insert number] days after receipt of written notice thereof.
            * c. Effect of Termination: [Insert the Registry's requirement for post-termination activities, e.g., will Data need to be returned or destroyed, can Researcher continue using the Data for a limited period].
        * **内容の比較結果**: 一致
        * **判断理由**: NIHの条文8bと8cは、UKBBの条文12と非常に類似しています。どちらも、重大な違反があった場合の終了、書面による通知、および終了後のデータ破棄や返却の必要性について言及しています。特に、重大な違反に対する終了の規定は、両文書で同様の構造を持っています。
