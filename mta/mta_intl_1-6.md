Researcher shall perform the Research and use the Data in strict compliance with: (i) this Agreement; (ii) all applicable laws, rules and regulations...

2.5 This MTA confers on the Applicant only those rights that are expressly granted to the Applicant.

2.6 In relation to the Materials supplied to the Applicant:

2.6.1 国際対応BB is the owner of the Materials, and 国際対応BB is the owner of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Materials; and All Data is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Registry. No ownership rights in or to the Data are transferred to Researcher hereunder.

2.6.2 国際対応BB hereby grants to the Applicant a revocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence (but not any ownership rights) during the Term to use the Materials for the Permitted Purpose, subject to the terms and conditions of this MTA. Registry hereby grants to Researcher the right to access and use the Data for the purpose expressly set forth in this Agreement.

3.1 The data generated by the Applicant in the performance of the Approved Research Project shall be deemed to fall into the following categories:

3.1.1 Results Data: data and methodology (for example, the SAS/R/Stata scripts) which underlie the Findings, and which would enable another competent researcher to generate the Findings;

3.1.2 Findings: the findings generated by the Applicant as a result of the Approved Research Project; and/or

3.1.3 Other Data: all other data generated by the Applicant which is not in one of the above two categories.

3.2 Except as provided in clause 3.3, the Applicant shall own the IPRs in their Findings, the Results Data and the Other Data. The Applicant hereby grants a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid up, royalty free, fully sub-licensable non-exclusive licence to 国際対応BB to use, reproduce, distribute, publish, store and otherwise disseminate the Findings, the Results Data and the Other Data. The User Institution agrees not to make intellectual property claims on these Data and not to use intellectual property protection in ways that would prevent or block access to, or use of, any element of these Data, or conclusion drawn directly from these Data. [If inventions are contemplated, may consider adding applicable invention ownership/rights language.]

3.3 Nothing in this MTA shall operate to assign to the Applicant any IPRs in the Materials. All Data is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Registry. No ownership rights in or to the Data are transferred to Researcher hereunder.

3.4 The Applicant confirms to 国際対応BB that 国際対応BB's receipt of and use of the Applicant's Findings and Results Data shall not infringe the rights, including any existing IPRS, of any third party. Such confirmation shall be:

3.4.1 deemed to be taken at the time, respectively, of the publication of the Findings or the return of the Results Data to 国際対応BB; and

3.4.2 given to the best of the Applicant's knowledge and belief, having made reasonable and diligent enquiry (but the extent of this obligation does not include any requirement on the Applicant to conduct external patent searches).

3.5 Subject always to the restriction in clause 3.7, 国際対応BB confirms that it shall have no rights or licence to the IPRs in relation to any inventions made by the Applicant as a result of using the Materials, Results Data, Findings or Other Data ("Applicant-Generated Inventions"). The User Institution can elect to perform further research that would add intellectual and resource capital to these data and decide to obtain intellectual property rights on these downstream discoveries. In this case, the User Institution agrees to implement licensing policies that will not obstruct further research and to follow the U.S. National Institutes of Health Best Practices for the Licensing of Genomic Inventions (2005) (https://www.icgc.org/files/daco/NIH_BestPracticesLicensingGenomicInventions_2005_en.pdf) in conformity with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for the Licensing of the Genetic Inventions (2006) (http://www.oecd.org/science/biotech/36198812.pdf). [If inventions are contemplated, may consider adding applicable invention ownership/rights language.]

3.6 However, the Applicant acknowledges that the 国際対応BB resource has been produced using a combination of the goodwill and contribution of 500,000 UK participants, charitable and public funding, the use of public resources (such as UK health-record data) and established with the express purpose of promoting the conduct of health-related research which is in the public interest.

3.7 Taking into account the acknowledgements in clause 3.6, the Applicant agrees that it shall not and shall not attempt to:

3.7.1 file any patents with claims directed to; or

3.7.2 otherwise seek to claim or enforce any IPRs in; the genotype-phenotype data within the Materials or in the genotype-phenotype data which has been generated by the Applicant in the course of the Approved Research Project. The User Institution agrees not to make intellectual property claims on these Data and not to use intellectual property protection in ways that would prevent or block access to, or use of, any element of these Data, or conclusion drawn directly from these Data.

3.8 国際対応BB expressly excludes any right of the Applicant to sub-licence any of the rights granted to the Materials under this MTA or to publish or distribute any of the Materials, except for the sole purpose of including a commensurate amount of supporting data in the Applicant's publication of its Findings. The User Institution agrees only to transfer or disclose these Data, in whole or part, or any material derived from these Data, to the Authorised Personnel.

3.9 For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted under this MTA to the Applicant to use the Materials are for the Permitted Purpose only. The User Institution agrees to only use these Data for the purpose of the Project (described in Appendix II) and only for Research Purposes. Researcher shall use the Data solely to perform the Research (and related activities) described in Exhibit B attached to this Agreement (the "Research").4.1 The Applicant confirms to 国際対応BB that all work performed by it using the Materials shall be carried out in compliance with: this Agreement; all applicable laws, rules and regulations; all Registry policies, procedures, and governance documents; all regulatory approval documents; and any documentation submitted by Researcher to Registry.

4.2 The Applicant shall retain the Materials in a secure network system, at a standard which would be reasonably expected for the storage of valuable and proprietary sensitive/confidential data. In addition, the Applicant shall be obliged to implement the appropriate technical and organisational measures as set out in Appendix I to protect the Materials from the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to the Materials (a "Data Security Incident"). By signing this MTA, the Applicant Pl confirms that the Security Measures set out in Appendix I are in place in order to protect the Materials.

4.3 The Applicant shall notify 国際対応BB without undue delay (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after becoming aware of a reasonably suspected "near miss" or actual Data Security Incident which affects the Materials. Researcher shall notify Registry within [may consider inserting a specific timeframe, e.g., two (2) business days, or a more general requirement, e.g., immediately/promptly upon discovery] of any uses or disclosures of Data not permitted by this Agreement. Such notification must be sent by email to DPO@ukbiobank.ac.uk with a copy to access@ukbiobank.ac.uk.

4.3.1 The Applicant shall not delay such notification on the basis that the information is incomplete, or the relevant investigation is ongoing. Further, the Applicant shall not make any external announcement, notifications to a supervisory authority or regulator about any such Data Security Incident without the express prior written consent of 国際対応BB, unless required by law to do so.

4.3.2 Both parties shall cooperate and provide reasonable assistance to each other to facilitate the handling of the Data Security Incident.

4.4 The Applicant confirms that it shall deal promptly and appropriately (in accordance with the Participants option to withdraw as set out on the 国際対応BB website here) with any "no further use" withdrawals by Participants which 国際対応BB notifies to the Applicant.

4.5 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to): developing, linking or re-engineering the Materials supplied to it so as to identify (directly or indirectly) any Participant; and linking or combining these Data to other information or archived data available in a way that could re-identify the Research Participants, even if access to that data has been formally granted to the User Institution or is freely available without restriction.

4.5.1 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to) developing, linking or re-engineering the Materials supplied to it so as to identify (directly or indirectly) any Participant. The User Institution agrees not to link or combine these Data to other information or archived data available in a way that could re-identify the Research Participants, even if access to that data has been formally granted to the User Institution or is freely available without restriction.

4.5.2 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to) identifying any Participant from the Materials provided by 国際対応BB.

4.5.3 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to) contacting any Participant.

4.6 In the event that the Applicant inadvertently identifies any Participant then it shall notify 国際対応BB immediately setting out (in reasonable detail) the circumstances by which it happened. Such notification must be sent by email to DPO@ukbiobank.ac.uk with a copy to access@ukbiobank.ac.uk.

4.7 Other than for the purposes of clause 4.6, the Applicant shall not:

4.7.1 share the identification of that Participant with any other person; or

4.7.2 attempt to contact the Participant themselves.

4.8 Without prejudice to the other provisions of this MTA, any actual or anticipatory breach of any provision of clauses 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 to 4.7 inclusive shall entitle 国際対応BB to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect and require the immediate return or destruction of any Materials provided by 国際対応BB. XXXXX may terminate this agreement by written notice to the User Institution. If this agreement terminates for any reason, the User Institution will be required to destroy any Data held, including copies and backup copies. This clause does not prevent the User Institution from retaining these data for archival purpose in conformity with audit or legal requirements. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party, which material breach is not cured within [insert number] days after receipt of written notice thereof.

Publication of lay summary, submission of annual report and return and publication of Findings

5.1 After the Applicant has received the Materials for the Approved Research Project, 国際対応BB shall be entitled to publish on its website:

5.1.1 the lay summary of the Approved Research Project contained in the Application (with the exception of any material that has been agreed by 国際対応BB would be kept confidential); and

5.1.2 summary details of the Applicant.

5.2 During the Term, the Applicant shall provide 国際対応BB with:

5.2.1 a report (with a summary section) setting out in reasonable detail the progress of the Approved Research Project in the form attached as Annex 3 (or in such other format as required by 国際対応BB from time to time) on an annual basis (from the Effective Date) which shall include the Findings the Applicant has made which in its reasonable view may be:

5.2.1 (a) published or pending publication; [Registry may insert its desired publication requirements or otherwise attach or cross-reference its policy governing publications].

5.2.1 (b) disclosed in a published patent; or

5.2.1 (c) otherwise of significance (in the context of medical research); and

5.2.2 a summary (and a copy of the application if requested) of any patents whose claims cover, or are intended to cover, an Applicant-Generated Invention within two (2) months of their publication.

5.3 In relation to the Annual Project Report, 国際対応BB:

5.3.1 shall have the ability to make the summary section of the Annual Project Report public, subject to the Applicant (as referred to in clause 5.7 below) retaining a reasonable period of confidentiality on items where patent rights still need to be filed; and

5.3.2 shall have the opportunity to ask the Applicant any reasonable questions arising from the Annual Project Report and the Applicant shall respond to such questions in a timely manner.

5.4 If the Annual Project Report, or any other information or data provided to 国際対応BB, contains any technology or data that is subject to applicable export controls, it shall be the responsibility of the Applicant to obtain any export licence that may be required to authorise the transmission of the Annual Project Report, information or data to 国際対応BB. The Applicant shall notify 国際対応BB at least one week in advance that an Annual Project Report, information or data is to be sent under an export licence and shall provide 国際対応BB with full details of the conditions of the licence and of the reasons for the control of the technology contained in the Annual Project Report, information or data.

5.5 In the event that the Annual Project Report is not received by 国際対応BB in the timeframe, manner and form prescribed, then the Applicant's rights under this MTA shall be suspended and the Applicant (together with any Collaborators) will not be able to download further data (either in terms of new data fields or updates of existing data fields) or access existing data via the research access platform until such time as the Annual Project Report has been duly and compliantly provided. If the Annual Project Report is still outstanding, notwithstanding reminders from 国際対応BB, 3 months after the relevant anniversary of the Effective Date, then 国際対応BB has the right to terminate this MTA by giving the Applicant written notice of termination and/or prevent the Applicant Institution (or Applicant PI) from applying for or accessing any further Materials from 国際対応BB.

5.6 The Applicant shall use All Reasonable Endeavours to publish the Findings (and provide 国際対応BB with a link thereto) within six (6) months after the Completion Date for the Approved Research Project: The User Institution will follow the Fort Lauderdale Guidelines... This includes but is not limited to recognising the contribution of the Data Producers and including a proper acknowledgement in all reports or publications resulting from the use of these Data. [Registry may insert its desired publication requirements or otherwise attach or cross-reference its policy governing publications].

5.6.1 in an academic journal; or

5.6.2 on an open-source publication site.

5.7 国際対応BB acknowledge and agree that the Applicant may keep such Findings confidential for a reasonable time in accordance with its reasonable research and development practices. For the avoidance of doubt, the Applicant is entitled to retain confidentiality regarding any Finding over which patent protection is being sought (and the patent has not yet been published).

5.8 If such Findings are made publicly available, 国際対応BB requires that the Results Data underlying such Findings shall be promptly returned or otherwise made available to 国際対応BB. 国際対応BB also requires that the Results Data are returned in a format which is appropriate and comprehensible (particularly for other researchers) along with any documentation which would be reasonably necessary to enable another researcher to interpret and understand the Results Data.

5.9 Within six (6) months after the publication of the Findings, the relevant Applicant shall provide to 国際対応BB the Results Data in such form and format as set out in clause 5.8 above (alternatively 国際対応BB and the relevant Applicant may agree that the relevant Applicant retains the Results Data on the basis that they are made publicly available to other Researchers and/or publicly available generally).

5.10 国際対応BB shall consider reasonably any written requests (containing an appropriate explanation) for an extension of the time limits set out in this clause.

5.11 The Applicant shall use All Reasonable Endeavours to publish a commensurate level of Findings in relation to the Approved Research Project within the first three (3) years of the Term (and in any subsequent extensions). Where this is not possible, the Applicant shall provide 国際対応BB with a reasonable explanation as to why it is not possible and an estimation of when a publication can be expected.

5.12 Unless otherwise stated in Annex 4, the Applicant is not required to obtain 国際対応BB's approval to any report of its Findings. The Applicant shall nevertheless provide a copy of any report of its Findings and any press release to 国際対応BB at least two (2) weeks before their expected date of first public presentation or publication in any format (e.g., paper journal, on-line report, meeting abstract). The Applicant shall upload such documents to AMS in the first instance. If this is not possible, the Applicant shall email such documents to access@ukbiobank.ac.uk. The User Institution agrees to follow the Fort Lauderdale Guidelines... This includes but is not limited to recognising the contribution of the Data Producers and including a proper acknowledgement in all reports or publications resulting from the use of these Data. [Registry may insert its desired publication requirements or otherwise attach or cross-reference its policy governing publications].

5.13 However, and notwithstanding the provisions of clause 5.12 above, the Applicant is required to promptly notify 国際対応BB in advance (in writing) if any report of its Findings is reasonably likely to provoke controversy or otherwise attract significant public attention. In such circumstances, 国際対応BB reserves the right to make such recommendations, reservations or suggestions on the report as it sees fit (and which it may make public) for consideration by the Applicant.

5.14 国際対応BB requires that the term "国際対応BB" is incorporated within the title and/or the abstract of any and all publications. [Registry may consider adding specific attribution requirements, to ensure that all references of Registry as the source of Data are accurate and consistent in any publications].

5.15 国際対応BB requires that any and all publications of Findings using 国際対応BB data include the following credit, which should be incorporated within the "Acknowledgements" of such publication: "This research has been conducted using the 国際対応BB Resource under application number [ ]." The User Institution agrees to follow the Fort Lauderdale Guidelines... This includes but is not limited to recognising the contribution of the Data Producers and including a proper acknowledgement in all reports or publications resulting from the use of these Data. [Registry may consider adding specific attribution requirements, to ensure that all references of Registry as the source of Data are accurate and consistent in any publications].

5.16 This acknowledgement to 国際対応BB should, when possible, be linked to reference search tools (such as PubMed and MEDLINE and/or DOI reference).

6.1 The Applicant agrees to pay the Access Charges as set out in the payment section of the Applicant's Application to 国際対応BB via bank transfer or Sage Pay, and in British pounds sterling (GBP). The Access Charges are stated to be exclusive of VAT. The Applicant shall pay any applicable VAT in addition to the Access Charges. [Registry may consider adding a section detailing the cost of data access, if applicable].

6.2 When paying the Access Charges, the Applicant shall quote the invoice number and/or Application Reference Number as the payment reference, and also send a remittance note to creditcontrol@ukbiobank.ac.uk.

6.3 The rights granted to the Applicant by 国際対応BB under this MTA are conditional on the Access Charges (and applicable VAT) being paid and so, for the avoidance of doubt, no Materials shall be provided to the Applicant until or unless the Access Charges (and applicable VAT) are received in full.

6.4 If payment of the Access Charges (and applicable VAT) has not been made within ninety (90) days of receipt of this MTA by the Applicant, the Applicant shall be required to re-apply for access to the 国際対応BB resource and Materials.
