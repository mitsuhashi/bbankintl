2.6 In relation to the Materials supplied to the Applicant:

2.6.1 国際対応BB is the owner of the Materials, and 国際対応BB is the owner of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Materials; and All Data is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Registry. No ownership rights in or to the Data are transferred to Researcher hereunder.

2.6.2 国際対応BB hereby grants to the Applicant a revocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence (but not any ownership rights) during the Term to use the Materials for the Permitted Purpose, subject to the terms and conditions of this MTA. Registry hereby grants to Researcher the right to access and use the Data for the purpose expressly set forth in this Agreement.

3.1 The data generated by the Applicant in the performance of the Approved Research Project shall be deemed to fall into the following categories:

3.1.1 Results Data: data and methodology (for example, the SAS/R/Stata scripts) which underlie the Findings, and which would enable another competent researcher to generate the Findings;

3.1.2 Findings: the findings generated by the Applicant as a result of the Approved Research Project; and/or

3.1.3 Other Data: all other data generated by the Applicant which is not in one of the above two categories.

3.2 Except as provided in clause 3.3, the Applicant shall own the IPRs in their Findings, the Results Data and the Other Data. The Applicant hereby grants a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid up, royalty free, fully sub-licensable non-exclusive licence to 国際対応BB to use, reproduce, distribute, publish, store and otherwise disseminate the Findings, the Results Data and the Other Data. The User Institution agrees not to make intellectual property claims on these Data and not to use intellectual property protection in ways that would prevent or block access to, or use of, any element of these Data, or conclusion drawn directly from these Data. [If inventions are contemplated, may consider adding applicable invention ownership/rights language.]

3.3 Nothing in this MTA shall operate to assign to the Applicant any IPRs in the Materials. All Data is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Registry. No ownership rights in or to the Data are transferred to Researcher hereunder.

3.4 The Applicant confirms to 国際対応BB that 国際対応BB's receipt of and use of the Applicant's Findings and Results Data shall not infringe the rights, including any existing IPRS, of any third party. Such confirmation shall be:

3.4.1 deemed to be taken at the time, respectively, of the publication of the Findings or the return of the Results Data to 国際対応BB; and

3.4.2 given to the best of the Applicant's knowledge and belief, having made reasonable and diligent enquiry (but the extent of this obligation does not include any requirement on the Applicant to conduct external patent searches).

3.5 Subject always to the restriction in clause 3.7, 国際対応BB confirms that it shall have no rights or licence to the IPRs in relation to any inventions made by the Applicant as a result of using the Materials, Results Data, Findings or Other Data ("Applicant-Generated Inventions"). The User Institution can elect to perform further research that would add intellectual and resource capital to these data and decide to obtain intellectual property rights on these downstream discoveries. In this case, the User Institution agrees to implement licensing policies that will not obstruct further research and to follow the U.S. National Institutes of Health Best Practices for the Licensing of Genomic Inventions (2005) (https://www.icgc.org/files/daco/NIH_BestPracticesLicensingGenomicInventions_2005_en.pdf) in conformity with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for the Licensing of the Genetic Inventions (2006) (http://www.oecd.org/science/biotech/36198812.pdf). [If inventions are contemplated, may consider adding applicable invention ownership/rights language.]

3.6 However, the Applicant acknowledges that the 国際対応BB resource has been produced using a combination of the goodwill and contribution of 500,000 UK participants, charitable and public funding, the use of public resources (such as UK health-record data) and established with the express purpose of promoting the conduct of health-related research which is in the public interest.

3.7 Taking into account the acknowledgements in clause 3.6, the Applicant agrees that it shall not and shall not attempt to:

3.7.1 file any patents with claims directed to; or

3.7.2 otherwise seek to claim or enforce any IPRs in; the genotype-phenotype data within the Materials or in the genotype-phenotype data which has been generated by the Applicant in the course of the Approved Research Project. The User Institution agrees not to make intellectual property claims on these Data and not to use intellectual property protection in ways that would prevent or block access to, or use of, any element of these Data, or conclusion drawn directly from these Data.

3.8 国際対応BB expressly excludes any right of the Applicant to sub-licence any of the rights granted to the Materials under this MTA or to publish or distribute any of the Materials, except for the sole purpose of including a commensurate amount of supporting data in the Applicant's publication of its Findings. The User Institution agrees only to transfer or disclose these Data, in whole or part, or any material derived from these Data, to the Authorised Personnel.

3.9 For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted under this MTA to the Applicant to use the Materials are for the Permitted Purpose only. The User Institution agrees to only use these Data for the purpose of the Project (described in Appendix II) and only for Research Purposes. Researcher shall use the Data solely to perform the Research (and related activities) described in Exhibit B attached to this Agreement (the "Research").
