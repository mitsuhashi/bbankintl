### 3. Generation of data by the Applicant üìä

**3.1 The data generated by the Applicant in the performance of the Approved Research Project shall be deemed to fall into the following categories:**

**3.1.1 Results Data: data and methodology which underlie the Findings, and which would enable another competent researcher to generate the Findings;**

**3.1.2 Findings: the findings generated by the Applicant as a result of the Approved Research Project; and/or**

**3.1.3 Other Data: all other data generated by the Applicant which is not in one of the above two categories.**
* These clauses are from UKBB and have no direct correspondence in the EGA or NIH documents.

**3.2 Except as provided in clause 3.3, the Applicant shall own the IPRs in their Findings, the Results Data and the Other Data. The Applicant hereby grants a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid up, royalty free, fully sub-licensable non-exclusive licence to the Data Provider to use, reproduce, distribute, publish, store and otherwise disseminate the Findings, the Results Data and the Other Data.**
* EGA clause 9 states the User Institution agrees not to make intellectual property claims on the Data and not to use intellectual property protection in ways that would prevent or block access to, or use of, any element of the Data or conclusion drawn directly from it.
* NIH clause 7.d mentions that if inventions are contemplated, applicable invention ownership/rights language may be added.

**3.3 Nothing in this MTA shall operate to assign to the Applicant any IPRs in the Materials.**
* NIH clause 7.a states that all Data is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Registry, and no ownership rights are transferred to the Researcher.

**3.4 The Applicant confirms to the Data Provider that the Data Provider's receipt of and use of the Applicant's Findings and Results Data shall not infringe the rights, including any existing IPRS, of any third party.**
* This clause is from UKBB and has no direct correspondence in the EGA or NIH documents.

**3.5 Subject always to the restriction in clause 3.7, the Data Provider confirms that it shall have no rights or licence to the IPRs in relation to any inventions made by the Applicant as a result of using the Materials, Results Data, Findings or Other Data.**
* EGA clause 10 states that the User Institution can elect to perform further research that would add intellectual and resource capital to the Data and decide to obtain intellectual property rights on these downstream discoveries, but agrees to implement licensing policies that will not obstruct further research.
* NIH clause 7.d mentions that if inventions are contemplated, applicable invention ownership/rights language may be added.

**3.6 However, the Applicant acknowledges that the Data Provider's resource has been produced using a combination of goodwill and contribution from participants, charitable and public funding, and established with the express purpose of promoting the conduct of health-related research which is in the public interest.**
* This clause is from UKBB and has no direct correspondence in the EGA or NIH documents.

**3.7 Taking into account the acknowledgements in clause 3.6, the Applicant agrees that it shall not and shall not attempt to:**

**3.7.1 file any patents with claims directed to; or**

**3.7.2 otherwise seek to claim or enforce any IPRs in; the genotype-phenotype data within the Materials or in the genotype-phenotype data which has been generated by the Applicant in the course of the Approved Research Project.**
* EGA clause 9 states the User Institution agrees not to make intellectual property claims on the Data and not to use intellectual property protection in ways that would prevent or block access to, or use of, any element of the Data, or conclusion drawn directly from these Data.

**3.8 The Data Provider expressly excludes any right of the Applicant to sub-licence any of the rights granted to the Materials/Data under this MTA or to publish or distribute any of the Materials/Data, except for the sole purpose of including a commensurate amount of supporting data in the Applicant's publication of its Findings.**

**3.9 For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted under this MTA to the Applicant to use the Materials/Data are for the Permitted Purpose only.**
* [cite_start]EGA clause 1 states the User Institution agrees to only use the Data for the purpose of the Project and for Research Purposes[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]NIH clauses 1.a and 1.b state that the Registry grants the Researcher the right to access and use the Data for the purpose expressly set forth in the agreement, which is solely to perform the Research described in Exhibit B, and any other uses are strictly prohibited[cite: 1].
