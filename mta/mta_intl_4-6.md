In addition, the Applicant shall be obliged to implement the appropriate technical and organisational measures as set out in Appendix I to protect the Materials from the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to the Materials (a "Data Security Incident"). By signing this MTA, the Applicant Pl confirms that the Security Measures set out in Appendix I are in place in order to protect the Materials.

4.3 The Applicant shall notify 国際対応BB without undue delay (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after becoming aware of a reasonably suspected "near miss" or actual Data Security Incident which affects the Materials. Researcher shall notify Registry within [may consider inserting a specific timeframe, e.g., two (2) business days, or a more general requirement, e.g., immediately/promptly upon discovery] of any uses or disclosures of Data not permitted by this Agreement. Such notification must be sent by email to DPO@ukbiobank.ac.uk with a copy to access@ukbiobank.ac.uk.

4.3.1 The Applicant shall not delay such notification on the basis that the information is incomplete, or the relevant investigation is ongoing. Further, the Applicant shall not make any external announcement, notifications to a supervisory authority or regulator about any such Data Security Incident without the express prior written consent of 国際対応BB, unless required by law to do so.

4.3.2 Both parties shall cooperate and provide reasonable assistance to each other to facilitate the handling of the Data Security Incident.

4.4 The Applicant confirms that it shall deal promptly and appropriately (in accordance with the Participants option to withdraw as set out on the 国際対応BB website here) with any "no further use" withdrawals by Participants which 国際対応BB notifies to the Applicant.

4.5 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to): developing, linking or re-engineering the Materials supplied to it so as to identify (directly or indirectly) any Participant; and linking or combining these Data to other information or archived data available in a way that could re-identify the Research Participants, even if access to that data has been formally granted to the User Institution or is freely available without restriction.

4.5.1 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to) developing, linking or re-engineering the Materials supplied to it so as to identify (directly or indirectly) any Participant. The User Institution agrees not to link or combine these Data to other information or archived data available in a way that could re-identify the Research Participants, even if access to that data has been formally granted to the User Institution or is freely available without restriction.

4.5.2 The Applicant is expressly prohibited from (or attempting to) identifying any Participant from the Materials provided by 国際対応BB.

Publication of lay summary, submission of annual report and return and publication of Findings

5.1 After the Applicant has received the Materials for the Approved Research Project, 国際対応BB shall be entitled to publish on its website:

5.1.1 the lay summary of the Approved Research Project contained in the Application (with the exception of any material that has been agreed by 国際対応BB would be kept confidential); and

5.1.2 summary details of the Applicant.

5.2 During the Term, the Applicant shall provide 国際対応BB with:

5.2.1 a report (with a summary section) setting out in reasonable detail the progress of the Approved Research Project in the form attached as Annex 3 (or in such other format as required by 国際対応BB from time to time) on an annual basis (from the Effective Date) which shall include the Findings the Applicant has made which in its reasonable view may be:

5.2.1 (a) published or pending publication; [Registry may insert its desired publication requirements or otherwise attach or cross-reference its policy governing publications].

5.2.1 (b) disclosed in a published patent; or

5.2.1 (c) otherwise of significance (in the context of medical research); and

5.2.2 a summary (and a copy of the application if requested) of any patents whose claims cover, or are intended to cover, an Applicant-Generated Invention within two (2) months of their publication.

5.3 In relation to the Annual Project Report, 国際対応BB:

5.3.1 shall have the ability to make the summary section of the Annual Project Report public, subject to the Applicant (as referred to in clause 5.7 below) retaining a reasonable period of confidentiality on items where patent rights still need to be filed; and

5.3.2 shall have the opportunity to ask the Applicant any reasonable questions arising from the Annual Project Report and the Applicant shall respond to such questions in a timely manner.

5.4 If the Annual Project Report, or any other information or data provided to 国際対応BB, contains any technology or data that is subject to applicable export controls, it shall be the responsibility of the Applicant to obtain any export licence that may be required to authorise the transmission of the Annual Project Report, information or data to 国際対応BB. The Applicant shall notify 国際対応BB at least one week in advance that an Annual Project Report, information or data is to be sent under an export licence and shall provide 国際対応BB with full details of the conditions of the licence and of the reasons for the control of the technology contained in the Annual Project Report, information or data.

5.5 In the event that the Annual Project Report is not received by 国際対応BB in the timeframe, manner and form prescribed, then the Applicant's rights under this MTA shall be suspended and the Applicant (together with any Collaborators) will not be able to download further data (either in terms of new data fields or updates of existing data fields) or access existing data via the research access platform until such time as the Annual Project Report has been duly and compliantly provided. If the Annual Project Report is still outstanding, notwithstanding reminders from 国際対応BB, 3 months after the relevant anniversary of the Effective Date, then 国際対応BB has the right to terminate this MTA by giving the Applicant written notice of termination and/or prevent the Applicant Institution (or Applicant PI) from applying for or accessing any further Materials from 国際対応BB.

5.6 The Applicant shall use All Reasonable Endeavours to publish the Findings (and provide 国際対応BB with a link thereto) within six (6) months after the Completion Date for the Approved Research Project: The User Institution will follow the Fort Lauderdale Guidelines... This includes but is not limited to recognising the contribution of the Data Producers and including a proper acknowledgement in all reports or publications resulting from the use of these Data. [Registry may insert its desired publication requirements or otherwise attach or cross-reference its policy governing publications].

5.6.1 in an academic journal; or

5.6.2 on an open-source publication site.

5.7 国際対応BB acknowledge and agree that the Applicant may keep such Findings confidential for a reasonable time in accordance with its reasonable research and development practices. For the avoidance of doubt, the Applicant is entitled to retain confidentiality regarding any Finding over which patent protection is being sought (and the patent has not yet been published).

5.8 If such Findings are made publicly available, 国際対応BB requires that the Results Data underlying such Findings shall be promptly returned or otherwise made available to 国際対応BB. 国際対応BB also requires that the Results Data are returned in a format which is appropriate and comprehensible (particularly for other researchers) along with any documentation which would be reasonably necessary to enable another researcher to interpret and understand the Results Data.

5.9 Within six (6) months after the publication of the Findings, the relevant Applicant shall provide to 国際対応BB the Results Data in such form and format as set out in clause 5.8 above (alternatively 国際対応BB and the relevant Applicant may agree that the relevant Applicant retains the Results Data on the basis that they are made publicly available to other Researchers and/or publicly available generally).

5.10 国際対応BB shall consider reasonably any written requests (containing an appropriate explanation) for an extension of the time limits set out in this clause.

5.11 The Applicant shall use All Reasonable Endeavours to publish a commensurate level of Findings in relation to the Approved Research Project within the first three (3) years of the Term (and in any subsequent extensions). Where this is not possible, the Applicant shall provide 国際対応BB with a reasonable explanation as to why it is not possible and an estimation of when a publication can be expected.

5.12 Unless otherwise stated in Annex 4, the Applicant is not required to obtain 国際対応BB's approval to any report of its Findings. The Applicant shall nevertheless provide a copy of any report of its Findings and any press release to 国際対応BB at least two (2) weeks before their expected date of first public presentation or publication in any format (e.g., paper journal, on-line report, meeting abstract). The Applicant shall upload such documents to AMS in the first instance. If this is not possible, the Applicant shall email such documents to access@ukbiobank.ac.uk. The User Institution agrees to follow the Fort Lauderdale Guidelines... This includes but is not limited to recognising the contribution of the Data Producers and including a proper acknowledgement in all reports or publications resulting from the use of these Data. [Registry may insert its desired publication requirements or otherwise attach or cross-reference its policy governing publications].

5.13 However, and notwithstanding the provisions of clause 5.12 above, the Applicant is required to promptly notify 国際対応BB in advance (in writing) if any report of its Findings is reasonably likely to provoke controversy or otherwise attract significant public attention. In such circumstances, 国際対応BB reserves the right to make such recommendations, reservations or suggestions on the report as it sees fit (and which it may make public) for consideration by the Applicant.

5.14 国際対応BB requires that the term "国際対応BB" is incorporated within the title and/or the abstract of any and all publications. [Registry may consider adding specific attribution requirements, to ensure that all references of Registry as the source of Data are accurate and consistent in any publications].

5.15 国際対応BB requires that any and all publications of Findings using 国際対応BB data include the following credit, which should be incorporated within the "Acknowledgements" of such publication: "This research has been conducted using the 国際対応BB Resource under application number [ ]." The User Institution agrees to follow the Fort Lauderdale Guidelines... This includes but is not limited to recognising the contribution of the Data Producers and including a proper acknowledgement in all reports or publications resulting from the use of these Data. [Registry may consider adding specific attribution requirements, to ensure that all references of Registry as the source of Data are accurate and consistent in any publications].

5.16 This acknowledgement to 国際対応BB should, when possible, be linked to reference search tools (such as PubMed and MEDLINE and/or DOI reference).

6.1 The Applicant agrees to pay the Access Charges as set out in the payment section of the Applicant's Application to 国際対応BB via bank transfer or Sage Pay, and in British pounds sterling (GBP). The Access Charges are stated to be exclusive of VAT. The Applicant shall pay any applicable VAT in addition to the Access Charges. [Registry may consider adding a section detailing the cost of data access, if applicable].

6.2 When paying the Access Charges, the Applicant shall quote the invoice number and/or Application Reference Number as the payment reference, and also send a remittance note to creditcontrol@ukbiobank.ac.uk.

6.3 The rights granted to the Applicant by 国際対応BB under this MTA are conditional on the Access Charges (and applicable VAT) being paid and so, for the avoidance of doubt, no Materials shall be provided to the Applicant until or unless the Access Charges (and applicable VAT) are received in full.

6.4 If payment of the Access Charges (and applicable VAT) has not been made within ninety (90) days of receipt of this MTA by the Applicant, the Applicant shall be required to re-apply for access to the 国際対応BB resource and Materials.
