* 16. Dispute resolution
    * The parties shall follow the procedure set out in this clause 16 if a Dispute arises. Either party may give the other a written Notice of Dispute, outlining its nature and full particulars along with supporting documents. Within five business days of the notice, representatives from both parties will attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. If they fail to resolve it within ten business days, the dispute may be escalated to the senior representatives of each party, who will seek to arrange a meeting to resolve it. If the senior representatives cannot resolve the dispute within thirty business days of escalation, the parties agree to enter into good faith mediation in accordance with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) Model Mediation Procedure. The mediator will be nominated by CEDR unless otherwise agreed. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within ten business days, either party may initiate court proceedings. Disputes regarding scientific, technical, or business decisions, and not legal issues, will be resolved by the senior representatives. This clause does not prevent any party from seeking interim/injunctive relief in a court of England and Wales to protect its rights and interests, provided it does not stay the mediation.
