### TERMS OF ACCESS

#### 1. Research Use
1.1. The Requester agrees that if access is approved, (1) the PI named in the DAR and (2) those named in the "Senior/Key Person Profile" section of the DAR, including the Information Technology Director and any trainee, employee, or contractor working on the proposed research project under the direct oversight of these individuals, shall become Approved Users of the requested dataset(s).

1.2. Research use will occur solely in connection with the approved research project described in the DAR, which includes a 1-2 paragraph description of the proposed research (i.e., a Research Use Statement).

1.3. Investigators interested in using Cloud Computing for data storage and analysis must request permission to use Cloud Computing in the DAR and identify the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or providers and/or Private Cloud System (PCS) that they propose to use. They must also submit a Cloud Computing Use Statement as part of the DAR.

13.1. Upon Project Close-out, the Requester and Approved Users agree to destroy all copies, versions, and Data Derivatives of the dataset(s)... in accord with the NIH Security Best Practices for Controlled-Access Data Subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy.

13.2. However, the Requester may retain these data as necessary to comply with any institutional policies (e.g., scientific data retention policy), law, and scientific transparency expectations for disseminated research results, and/or journal policies.

13.3. A Requester who retains data for any of these purposes continues to be a steward of the data and is responsible for the management of the retained data in accordance with the NIH Security Best Practices... and any institutional policies.

13.4. Any retained data may only be used by the PI and Requester to support the findings (e.g., validation) resulting from the research described in the DAR... The data may not be used to answer any additional research questions... unless the Requester submits a new DAR and is approved by NIH.

13.5. If a Requester retains data for any of these purposes, the relevant portions of Terms 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 13 remain in effect after termination of this Data Use Certification Agreement. These terms remain in effect until the data is destroyed.
