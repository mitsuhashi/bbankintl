* 7. Annual Confirmation and Audit
    * 7.1 During the Term, UK Biobank requires the Applicant Pl to confirm on an annual basis that the Approved Research Project remains compliant with the provisions of the MTA (and the Annexes). Specifically, the Applicant PI shall provide UK Biobank with such confirmation as part of the Annual Project Report in the form attached at Annex 3. In the event that the Annual Project Report is not received by UK Biobank in the timeframe, manner and form prescribed, UK Biobank reserves the rights set out in clause 5.5 above.
    * 7.2 In circumstances where UK Biobank reasonably believes that a Data Security Incident or other serious incident has occurred then, on notice to the Applicant, in order to confirm or investigate compliance with the provisions of this MTA, UK Biobank may itself or via appropriate third parties:
        * 7.2.1 choose to undertake an audit (either in person or remotely) in order to review the security, storage or other arrangements for the Materials; and
        * 7.2.2 request such additional information about the Approved Research Project and/or its progress as UK Biobank may, from time to time, reasonably require.
    * 7.3 UK Biobank shall bear the costs of such audits unless a material default within the procedures and processes of the relevant Applicant is discovered, in which case the relevant Applicant shall be obliged to reimburse the reasonable costs of UK Biobank and any relevant third parties.
    * 7.4 UK Biobank confirms that its audit rights shall be exercisable no more than once a year and on the provision of reasonable notice (which may be immediate in the event of a Data Security Incident or other serious incident) to the Applicant. As far as practically possible, UK Biobank agrees to coordinate any site visits and audits with the other relevant parties.
* 8. Confidentiality
    * 8.1 Subject to the exceptions in clause 8.2, UK Biobank shall keep confidential any information disclosed to it in writing by the Applicant that is marked confidential ("Applicant's Confidential Information") and shall not disclose such information to any person.
    * 8.2 UK Biobank may disclose the Applicant's Confidential Information where expressly permitted by this MTA or when:
        * 8.2.1 it is required to be disclosed by law, by any governmental or other regulatory authority, by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction; or
        * 8.2.2 it can be shown by UK Biobank (to the Applicant's reasonable satisfaction) to have been known by UK Biobank before disclosure to it by such Applicant; or
        * 8.2.3 it was lawfully disclosed to UK Biobank by a third party who did not impose any restrictions on its disclosure; or
        * 8.2.4 the information was in (or enters into) the public domain other than by reason of a breach of this clause by UK Biobank; or
        * 8.2.5 UK Biobank and the Applicant agree, acting reasonably, that such information is trivial or obvious, or they agree in writing that such disclosure may be permitted.
* 9. Data Protection
    * Relationship of the parties
    * 9.1 The parties acknowledge that UK Biobank and the Applicant are independent controllers with respect to the Participant Level Data that is processed in accordance with this MTA, and that the Applicant shall process the Participant Level Data strictly for the Permitted Purpose. In no event shall the parties process the Participant Level Data as joint controllers.
    * 9.2 Each party shall be individually and separately responsible for complying with the obligations that apply to it as a controller under Data Protection Legislation.
    * Cooperation
    * 9.3 In the event that the Applicant, Applicant PI or any Applicant Researcher receives any correspondence, enquiry or complaint from a Participant, regulator or other third party ("Correspondence") in connection with the processing of the Participant Level Data, it shall promptly inform UK Biobank giving full details of the same. In all circumstances, the Applicant, Applicant PI or any Applicant Researcher shall: (i) obtain UK Biobank's written approval before responding to the Correspondence, including approval of the contents of any response; and (ii) subject to Data Protection Legislation, permit UK Biobank to respond directly to the Correspondence.
    * Where the Applicant is located outside of the UK
    * 9.4 Where UK Biobank transfers Participant Level Data to an Applicant outside the UK to a territory that has not been specified as ensuring an adequate level of protection in accordance with Data Protection Legislation, the parties agree that the UK Addendum shall be automatically incorporated into this MTA by reference and deemed to be completed as set out in Part B of Annex 1 of this MTA.
    * 9.5 If there is any conflict between the MTA and the UK Addendum, the UK Addendum will prevail.
    * International transfers by the Applicant
    * 9.6 The Applicant shall not process any Participant Level Data (nor permit any Participant Level Data to be processed) in a territory outside of the UK (or where clause 9.4 applies, where processing occurs in a subsequent territory) unless it has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with Data Protection Legislation.
* 10. Limitation of Liability
    * 10.1 The parties agree that:

        * 10.1.2 subject to clauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.5, the Applicant's maximum aggregate Liability under this MTA and/or in relation to the Approved Research Project shall be limited to the Access Charges paid or payable by the Applicant to UK Biobank (whether or not invoiced to the Applicant) in relation to the Approved Research Project.

    * 10.3 Nothing in this MTA shall operate to exclude or limit any Liability which cannot legally be limited including but not limited to liability for:
        * 10.3.1 death or personal injury caused by negligence;
        * 10.3.2 for its fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and
        * 10.3.3 for any matter for which it is not permitted by law to exclude or limit, or to attempt to exclude or limit, its Liability.

    * 10.5 Nothing in this MTA shall operate to exclude or limit the Applicant’s Liability to UK Biobank for any loss, damage, costs or expenses arising from:

        * 10.5.3 any circumstance set out in clauses 4.5 and 4.7; and
        * 10.5.4 any Data Security Incident which is caused by the Applicant.
* 11. Term
    * 11.1 The term of this MTA shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the Completion Date unless terminated sooner in accordance with clause 12 or in accordance with law.
    * 11.2 The Term of this MTA may be extended by the Applicant (and with the agreement of UK Biobank) during the final year of the Approved Research Project in the following one (1) year increments:
        * 11.2.1 for a minimum of period of one (1) year;
        * 11.2.2 for a period of two (2) years; or
        * 11.2.3 for a maximum period of three (3) years;

    * 11.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the extensions set out in clause 11.2 above can be applied cumulatively (subject to applicable Access Charges) so that, for example, an extension of 3 years may be granted to take the Approved Research Project duration from 3 years to 6 years, and this may then be extended by a further 3 years to 9 years and so on.

    * 12.1 UK Biobank shall be entitled to terminate this MTA immediately by written notice to the Applicant if the Applicant:
